🌿 Plant Disease Detection

This project is a Python-based Machine Learning system that detects diseases in plants using image datasets. It is designed to be flexible and adaptable — by changing the dataset, the same model can be used to detect diseases in different crops, not just tomatoes. The dataset for this project was initially sourced from Kaggle, and the system leverages deep learning for accurate classification.

✨ Features

🖼️ Image-based disease detection

🤖 Machine Learning with Python (TensorFlow/Keras)

📂 Dataset support for multiple crops (extendable)

📊 Training, validation, and accuracy evaluation

🌱 Scalable solution for smart agriculture

🚀 Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: TensorFlow / Keras, NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, Matplotlib

Dataset: Kaggle (modifiable for other crops)

📝 How to Change Dataset

Download a new dataset (e.g., for potato, maize, or rice) from Kaggle or another source.

Replace the current dataset folder (/traning) with your new dataset.

Update the data loading path in the code (traiingn.py).

Retrain the model using the new dataset.
